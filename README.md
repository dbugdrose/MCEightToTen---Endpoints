 // Design an API based on mini challenges from the Combine, each with their own service file, own controller, and data validation.

//Endpoints:

//1. Magic 8 Ball: created a endpoint generates 8 unique responses.


//2. Guess It: created 3 endpoints that takes an input, then outputs if the number is higher or lower than the number guessed.
Easy Mode 1-10
Medium Mode 1-50
Hard Mode 1-100

//3. Restaurant Picker: created 1 endpoint that takes an input and generates a Randomly Generated Restaurant based on the category chosen. 10 Restaurants per category.


// Bryce Mack: Great validation. The correct output is given. Lol i almost beat hard mode.
